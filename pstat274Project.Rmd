# Time series of sales data from a secret product of a secret company. 

The time series is daily sales data from a secret product of a secret company from its begining until Nov8,2018


```{r}
data =read.csv("secretTimeSeries.csv")
names(data)=c("unixDates","Nadopts")
tail(data)
```


But we have to be careful, not all dates are recorded!!!

```{r}
plot(data$unixDates,data$Nadopts,type="l")
```

To use xts, we have to have a specific date, then we can have




```{r include=FALSE}
secretTS = ts(data$Nadopts)
```

```{r}
acf(secretTS)
```

```{r}
pacf(secretTS)
```

```{r}
require(qpcR)
require(MuMIn)
minAICp=0
minAICq=0 
minAIC = 10000000000000
for(p in seq(25:40)){
  print(p)
  for(q in seq(25:40)){
    currAIC = AICc( arima(secretTS, order = c(p,0,q), method = "ML")  )
    if (currAIC<minAIC){
      minAICp=p
      minAICq=q
      minAIC =currAIC
    }
    
  }
}
print(minAICp)
print(minAICq)
print(minAIC)
```
